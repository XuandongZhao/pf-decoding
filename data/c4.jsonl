Structures of the type studied are often called metamaterials or metastructures as they behave in a way that is beyond their constituents.

Periodic structures are considered for their unique wave properties, as well as for ease of design and application. First, possible configurations are identified. Then, dynamic reconfiguration is investigated as a fast and versatile method for switching configurations. Bloch wave analysis is applied to magneto-elastic lattices to investigate the introduction of anisotropic wave propagation, opening of bandgaps, and changes in wave speeds due to geometric lattice reconfiguration. The equivalent continuum properties of the lattice structures are also calculated, using a homogenization methodology. Reconfiguration from hexagonal to re-entrant lattices produces over an order of magnitude change in stiffness while converting the lattice from having isotropic to orthotropic properties. This thesis also addresses two other topics relevant to the development of periodic structures that seek to control wave energy. The first, pursuing novel wave control, is topologically protected edge mode. Building by anal"}

In the past, such analyses have been conducted by using different kinds of templates and spreadsheets. Due to the semi-formal nature - especially of the work system meta model - it seems favorable to translate this conceptual meta model into an implementation-oriented one that permits to generate model editors in the form of software applications.
